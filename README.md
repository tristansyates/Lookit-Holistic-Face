## Robust Holistic Face Processing in Early Childhood During the COVID-19 Pandemic  

Stimuli and code used to conduct research on the composite face effect on LookIt with LLAMB Lab at Haskins Laboratories.  

**Stimuli folders**    
> *Lookit\_audio*: Contains the audio that was played at various points of the experiment.     
> *Lookit\_images*: Contains images that were shown at various points of the experiment, including practice trials.     
> *aligned*: Contains upright aligned face images shown during Experiment 1.    
> *aligned\_inverted*: Contains inverted aligned face images shown during Experiment 2.    
> *misaligned*: Contains upright misaligned face images shown during the experiment.    
> *misaligned\_inverted*: Contains inverted misaligned face images shown during the experiment.    

**Code folders**    
> *Python*: Contains Jupyter notebook used to make various figures, explore, and reorganize raw data.  
> *R*: Contains R script used to conduct repeated-measures ANOVAs.  

**Data folders**   
 
> *Holistic\_Face\_Subject\_Data.csv*: file that contains information about subjects' age, gender, and experiment they participated in 
> *Holistic\_Face\_COVID\_answers.csv*: file that contains information about subjects' answers to the COVID-19 questionnaire (Experiment 1 data only)

> *Expt1*: Contains CSV files for each individual subject who participated in Experiment 1.   
>> *trials*: trial number           
>> *choices*: which button the child chose (same or different)           
>> *durations*: total trial time in seconds (between the end of the audio prompt  and button press)        
>> *left\_images*: name of the image shown on the left side of the screen        
>> *right\_images*: name of the image shown on the right side of the screen       
>> *conditions*: what trial type it was (aligned\_same, misaligned\_same, aligned\_different, or misaligned\_different)        
>> *accuracies*: whether or not the child's answer was correct

> *Expt2*: Contains CSV files for each individual subject who participated in Experiment 2.
